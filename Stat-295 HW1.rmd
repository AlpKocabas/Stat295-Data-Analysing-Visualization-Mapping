# Question 2

-   **Loading necessary packages.**

    ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyverse)

    ```

-   **(i) Reading the data set, assigning name as chocolate. Printing
    first 6 rows.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-18/chocolate.csv")
    head(chocolate)
    ```

-   **(i) Examining the structure and comments.**

    ```{r}
    str(chocolate)
    ```

The data set likely contains information about chocolate products,
including details like manufacturer, origin, ingredients,
characteristics, and ratings.

-   **(ii) Converting all the characters into factors.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate <- chocolate %>%
      mutate_if(is.character, factor)
    ```

-   **(iii) Obtaining some statistics with respect to different company
    locations. Printing the 10 observations. And comments.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
      group_by(company_location) %>%
      summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
                sd_rating = sd(rating),
                median_rating = median(rating),
                range_rating = diff(range(rating))) %>% 
      head(10)
    ```

If we consider 10 rows of statistics, mean ratings vary 3.1 to 3.75 ,
standart deviatons is also vary and there are differences among
locations. Median ratings are between 3.00 to 3.75 for this 10
examination. And there are range ratings that varies from location to
location between 0 to 3.

-   **(iv) Finding the chocolates that its review date is equal to 2020
    and country of bean origin is equal to Colombia.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
      filter(review_date == 2020 & country_of_bean_origin == "Colombia")
    ```

-   **(v) Taking the mean of chocolate rating and cocoa percent
    according to the company location.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
      group_by(company_location) %>%
      summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
                mean_cocoa_percent = mean(as.numeric(factor(cocoa_percent))))
    ```

-   **(vi) Selecting company manufacturer, company location and country
    of bean origin shortly. Printing the first 10 rows of the data
    frame.** 

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
     select(starts_with("c")) %>%
      head(10)
    ```

-   **(vii) Filtering that company location in Switzerland whose rating
    between 3.25 and 3.5. Taking the five observations.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
      filter(company_location == "Switzerland" & rating >= 3.25 & rating <= 3.5) %>%
      head(5)
    ```

-   **(viii) Mean of the rating column for each company locations that
    ordered by descending.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
      group_by(company_location) %>%
      summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating)) %>%
      arrange(desc(mean_rating))
    ```

-   **(ix) Counting the observations are assigned Bonnat for each
    country of bean origin.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate %>%
      filter(company_manufacturer == "Bonnat") %>%
      count(country_of_bean_origin, sort = TRUE)
    ```

-   **(x) Creating a new column called Rating Percentage, which is
    percentage version of the rating column & rating the chocolates.**

    ```{r}
    chocolate <- chocolate %>%
      mutate(Rating_Percentage = rating / 4 * 100,
             Class = case_when(
               Rating_Percentage < 25 ~ "Low",
               Rating_Percentage < 50  ~ "Medium",
               Rating_Percentage <= 87.5 ~ "Tasty",
               Rating_Percentage >87.5 ~ "Excellent"
             ))

    ```

# Question 3

-   **Calling necessary libraries.**

    ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    library(ggplot2)
    library(dplyr)
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

-   **(i) Reading data and named it as nmmaps.**

    ```{r}
    nmmaps<-read.csv("https://www.cedricscherer.com/data/chicago-nmmaps-custom.csv")

    ```

-   **(i)Examining the relationship between date and temp based on the
    year.**

    ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    ggplot(nmmaps,aes(as.Date(date),temp,color="red"))+
      geom_point()+
      labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature(°F)",
           title = "Relationship between Date & Temperature based on Year")+
      facet_wrap(~year, labeller = label_both)
    ```

-   **Interpretation for plot 1.**

    Although there are no major changes in general, temperatures in the
    last months of the year have started to decrease over the years. The
    lowest temperature was reached in early 1997, and the highest
    temperature was reached in mid-1999. In general, the temperature
    first increased and then decreased within a year.

-   **(ii) Factoring season variables.**

    ```{r}
    nmmaps$season<-factor(nmmaps$season,labels = c("Autumn", "Spring", "Summer", "Winter"))

    ```

-   **(ii) Examining the relationship between date, temp and season.**

    ```{r}
    ggplot(nmmaps,aes(as.Date(date),temp,color=season))+
      geom_point()+
      labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature(°F)", title = "Relationship between Date, Temperature, and Season" )
    ```

-   **Interpretation for plot 2.**

    The temperature change generally followed a regular pattern.
    Temperature change was more vary in winter and autumn. As we see in
    the first graph, the temperature reached its lowest value at the
    beginning of 1997 and its peak in the middle of 1999.

-   **(iii) The relationship between temperature and dewpoint, and the
    correlation.**

    ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    ggplot(nmmaps,aes(temp,dewpoint))+
      geom_point()+
      labs(x = "Temperature(°F)", 
           y = "Dewpoint",
           title = "Temperature vs Dewpoint") +
      geom_smooth(method="lm")
    ```

-   **Interpretation for plot 3.**

    In this graph we observe the relationship between temperature and
    dewpoint. There is a strong linear relationship between temperature
    and dewpoint with small deviations. Simply we can conclude that the
    dewpoint increases as the temperature increases.

# Question 4

-   In this part, we tried to fetch earthquake data from the Terremoti
    website, analyzed the data, categorized the earthquakes into
    different classes based on their magnitudes, and visualized it on a
    Leaflet map.

      html_table()
    ```

    ```{r}
    earthquake <- as.data.frame(tables)
    str(earthquake)
    ```

                            ifelse(Magnitude<=3.7, "Light","Major")))
    ```

-   **Defining colors for different earthquake classes.**

    ```{r}
    colors <- c("yellow","orange3", "darkred")
    color_vector <- colorFactor(colors, levels = c("Minor","Light","Major"))
    ```

-   **Creating Leaflet map. (Please click the circles to open popups.)**

    ```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

    leaflet() %>%
      addTiles() %>%
      addCircles(data = earthquake,
                 ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
                 weight = 30,
                 radius = 100,
                 popup = paste0(

                 label = ~Region,
                 color = ~color_vector(Class)) %>%
      setView(lng = median(earthquake$Longitude),
              lat = median(earthquake$Latitude),

**End Of The Work.**

Note: Dear teacher, even though we used resources on the internet when
we got stuck while answering the questions, our goal for each question
was to learn, and it was a very educational assignment for us. Thank
you, have a good day.
